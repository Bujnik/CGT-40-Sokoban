 CodeGym mini project - level 40 - Sokoban

Task objectives:

Today we're going to write our own implementation of the game Sokoban.<br>
This is a logical puzzle game. You can read more about it on Wikipedia. <br>
The game will consist of 3 main components (as you may have guessed, you'll need the MVC pattern).<br>
The graphical interface will be implemented using Swing.

 

__________________________________________________________
My takeaways: <br>
-> Working with Swing library <br>
-> Practice with MVC pattern
